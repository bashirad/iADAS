# Capping Project for Village of Rhinebeck
This application stack is the web frontend for ADAS - Asher Dam Alert System - and the backend code that connects the website to data being collected from devices installed in the Landsman Kill (creek) in Rhinebeck. The data is collected on Solinst branded devices and transmitted via a cellular network connection over the internet to a secure server in the ECRL (Enterprise Computing Research Lab) in the baesment of Hancock.
## Prerequisites
1) Docker
2) docker-compose
3) API keys

## Application Stack
This application consists of three services, `mysql`, `adas-web`, and `nginx`.<br>
### MySQL
MySQL is storing weather data from the weather API, along with users and threshold information.

### ADAS Web
Adas Web is the node web application. This is the frontend service and backend scripts to get weather data.

### Nginx
Nginx is running as a reverse proxy to add SSL to the connection.

## Running
### Configuration
The two files that need to be edited before running are `config.json` and `docker-compose.yml`.<br>
Copy or move the example files files
```
mv config-example.json config.json
mv docker-compose-example.yml docker-compose.yml
```

Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file. You need to set the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` variable
```
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD={PWORD}
    volumes:
      - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
      - ./db.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/db.sql:ro
...
```
Next, edit the config.json file.
```
{
    "database": {
        "host" : "mysql",
        "user" : "root",
        "password" : "pword",
        "database" : "damdb"
    },
    "server" : {
        "port" : "8080"
    },
    "externalAPIs" : {
        "weathergov" : {
            "url" : "api.weather.gov"
        },
        "darksky" : {
            "url" : "api.darksky.net",
            "key" : "abc-123"
        },
        "openweathermap" : {
            "url" : "api.openweathermap.org",
            "key" : "def-xyz"
        },
        "numRequests" : "1"
    },
    "email" : {
        "address" : "myemail@addr.com",
        "password" : "pword"
    }
}
```
The Database `password` should match what you entered for `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`. Make sure all other keys are filled out.<br><br>
#### SSL
The Nginx service is expecting SSL keys in `certs/ssl.*`. You can generate your own SSL certs via openssl.
```
cd {/path/to/directory}/certs
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ssl.key -out ssl.crt
```
If you are going use your own SSL certs, you can either name them `ssl.key` and `ssl.crt` or change the Nginx config file to match the SSL files name.


### Executing
To run ADAS, `cd` into the directory.<br>
You need to build the container.
```
docker-compose build
```

Once the containers are built, run the container.
```
docker-compose up -d
```

To shut the container down, run:
```
docker-compose down
```
